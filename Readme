# Digital Pet Simulator 

This is a fun, interactive **object-oriented Python program** that simulates taking care of a virtual pet. The pet has its own hunger, energy, happiness levels, and can learn tricks over time. You can feed it, play with it, let it sleep, train it, and track its well-being.

##Features

- Feed the pet to reduce hunger
- Let it sleep to restore energy
- Play to increase happiness (but reduces energy & adds hunger)
- Train it to learn cool tricks
- Check its current status
- View all tricks it has learned

##  OOP Concepts Used

This project demonstrates key **object-oriented programming** concepts:

- **Class & Object creation**
- **Encapsulation** of behavior into methods
- **State tracking** using attributes (hunger, happiness, etc.)
- **Method interaction** with internal state
